**Abstract:** Climate variability shapes economic conditions in Central America, but its short-term political effects remain poorly understood. This paper assembles a high-frequency monthly panel for six countries (2012–2024), combining conflict event datasets (MLP and MLEED), climate indicators (temperature anomalies, precipitation, SPEI-based drought), and inflation-based measures of economic stress. Using ElasticNet to select relevant lag structures and a mediation design to separate direct and indirect pathways, I find that droughts and temperature shocks generate immediate increases in inflation, while direct effects on protest and violence largely dissipate once economic stress is accounted for. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
